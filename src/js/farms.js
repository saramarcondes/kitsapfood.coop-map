		description:
			"Roots Farm is a small farm in Poulsbo, that is grounded in the principles of environmental sensitivity. Roots Farm relies on heavy mulching, a permaculture method that decreases the need for watering. Soil cultivated with heavy mulching shows increased nutrient levels and is full of beneficial organisms, including mycorrhizae and other fungi, and earthworms. Their animals are rotated in fields and pastures for insect control, tilling and fertilizing - virtually eliminating the need for gas power implements.",
